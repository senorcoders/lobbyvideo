                        Patient Soothe was founded by Dr. Naomi Zuckerman, DDS and dental assistant Tracy Warner.  Their goal was to find a simple and cost-effective way to help keep patients calm while waiting in doctor’s offices for care. They observed that less anxious clients make for better patient relations and outcomes. Upon further research, Dr. Zuckerman and Mrs. Warner found an abundance of scientific evidence that supports watching specific fish in certain situations is relaxing and can raise patient’s pain thresholds for up to 30 minutes post-viewing.  This is a noteworthy revelation, and one that is definitely an asset to any practitioner.  The pair also found studies that indicate hi-definition video fish were MORE effective than a real aquarium.

                        Dr. Zuckerman and Mrs. Warner understand the need for having alternative measures to relax patients due to more stringent polices set forth by the DEA and various medical boards. They enlisted their friend Howard Lefkowitz, former television executive, Vice President of Earthlink, president of Home Shopping telemedia company, CEO of Vegas.com, and chief revenue of Row 44.  Mr. Lefkowitz has been in streaming video and ecommerce for decades.  He is personally responsible for the first cybercast live from the White House and the television products that are deployed on Southwest Airlines, Norwegian Air, and other airlines around the globe.
